# NGEmu
NGEmu is a HLE N-Gage emulator written in C++.

IRC channel: #NGEmu on Freenode

## Status
Some basic game code runs, a couple HLE functions implemented.

## System Requirements
* Modern 64-bit CPU
* Vulkan compatible graphics card
* 64-bit OS

## Compiling
NGEmu can be currently only compiled using Visual Studio 2015 on a Windows computer. Linux support is planned for the future.

## SDK
If you've got a N-Gage SDK, parts of it or any leads for obtaining it, please contact us either on our IRC channel (#NGEmu on Freenode) or through ![](https://i.imgur.com/bPYEQsM.png)  
Since a NGEmu is a HLE emulator, we depend on knowing what the actual methods that games use do. This is not really possible to know in any way without the SDK.
